## Compatible Systems

- Windows 10/11: WSL2 / Git BASH
- Mac ARM / Intel
- Linux
- Raspberry Pi 4

## System Requirements

Ensure your machine satisfies the requirements:

- Python `==3.10`
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) `>=1.4.0`
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Resource Requirements

- You will need to fund certain addresses with the following funds when requested: 0.02 ETH (Ethereum mainnet) + 10 USDC (Ethereum mainnet) + 0.01 ETH (Optimism chain) + 0.01 ETH (Base chain). Additionally some quantity of OLAS bridged to Optimism if you want to stake.

- You need 3 RPCs for your agent instance for respectively Ethereum, Optimism, and Base.
```bash
Please enter an Ethereum RPC URL:
Please enter an Optimism RPC URL:
Please enter a Base RPC URL:
  ```

- You will need your Tenderly Access Key, Tenderly account Slug, and Tenderly Project Slug. Get one at https://dashboard.tenderly.co/ under settings. 
```bash
Please enter your Tenderly API Key:
Please enter your Tenderly Account Slug:
Please enter your Tenderly Project Slug: 
  ```
Refer to the Tenderly Documentation for more info https://docs.tenderly.co/account/projects
## Run the Service

Clone this repository locally and execute:
```bash
chmod +x run_service.sh
./run_service.sh
```
When prompted, add the corresponding RPCs and Tenderly info, send funds to the prompted address and you're good to go!

### Creating a local user account

When run for the first time, the agent will setup for you a password protected local account. You will be asked to enter and confirm a password as below. 
Please be mindful of storing it in a secure space, for future use. **Hint:** If you do not want to use a password just press Enter when asked to enter and confirm your password.

```bash
Creating a new local user account...
Please enter a password: 
Please confirm your password: 
Creating the main wallet...
```

## Staking

The agent will need your answer on staking. If you plan to run it as a non staking agent, please answer _n_ to the question below. Otherwise, please answer _y_ and, consequently when prompted, fund your agent with the required number of bridged Olas in Optimism Chain.

```bash
Do you want to stake your service? (y/n):
```

### Notes:

- Staking is currently in a testing phase, so the number of trader agents that can be staked might be limited.
- Within each staking period (24hrs) staking happens after the agent has reached its staking contract's KPIs. In the current agent's version, this takes approxiamtely 45 minutes of activity.
- In case a service becomes inactive and remains so for more than 2 staking periods (approx. 48 hours), it faces eviction from the staking program and ceases to accrue additional rewards.

### Service is Running

Once the command has completed, i.e. the service is running, you can see the live logs with:

```bash
docker logs optimus_abci_0 --follow
```

To inspect the tree state transition of the current run of the agent run:
```bash
poetry run autonomy analyse logs --from-dir .optimus/services/[service-hash]/deployment/persistent_data/logs/  --agent aea_0 --fsm --reset-db
```
where `[service-hash]` is the onchain representation of the agent code that you're running and can be found by doing

```bash
ls .optimus/services
```

To obtain a report of your agent's activity run
```bash
poetry run python staking_report.py
```

To stop your agent, use:

```bash
./stop_service.sh
```

## Update between versions

Simply pull the latest script:

```bash
git pull origin
```

Then continue above with "Run the script".


## Advice for Windows users using Git BASH

We provide some hints to have your Windows system ready to run the agent. The instructions below have been tested in Windows 11.

Execute the following steps in a PowerShell terminal:

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and Git Bash:

    ```bash
    winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
    ```

2. Install Python 3.10:

    ```bash
    winget install Python.Python.3.10
    ```

3. Close and re-open the PowerShell terminal.

4. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/):

    ```bash
    curl.exe -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -
    ```

5. Add Poetry to your user's path:

    ```bash
    $existingUserPath = (Get-Item -Path HKCU:\Environment).GetValue("PATH", $null, "DoNotExpandEnvironmentNames")

    $newUserPath = "$existingUserPath;$Env:APPDATA\Python\Scripts"

    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $newUserPath, "User")
    ```

6. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/):

    ```bash
    winget install -e --id Docker.DockerDesktop
    ```

7. Log out of your Windows session and then log back in.

8. Open [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and leave it opened in the background.

Now, open a Git Bash terminal and follow the instructions in the "[Run the script](#run-the-script)" section as well as the subsequent sections. You might need to install Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater.
